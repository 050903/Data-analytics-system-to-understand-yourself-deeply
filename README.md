# üéØ Personal Insight & Development Tool üß†‚ú®

A comprehensive Python application designed for personal self-assessment, analysis, and visualization of psychological, behavioral, and cognitive traits. This tool guides users through a structured questionnaire, processes their responses, and generates insightful reports including data visualizations to foster self-awareness and personal growth.

The application's user interface and question content are primarily in Vietnamese.

## üåü Core Features

*   **Structured Questionnaire:** üìù A curated set of 50 questions spanning five key personal dimensions:
    *   **Core Values (Gi√° tr·ªã c·ªët l√µi):** Understanding fundamental beliefs and principles.
    *   **Multiple Intelligences (Tr√≠ th√¥ng minh ƒëa d·∫°ng):** Identifying dominant types of intelligence based on Howard Gardner's theory (adapted).
    *   **Learning Motivation (ƒê·ªông l·ª±c h·ªçc t·∫≠p):** Assessing drivers and motivations behind learning.
    *   **Personal Goals (M·ª•c ti√™u c√° nh√¢n):** Evaluating clarity and focus on personal objectives.
    *   **Self-Awareness (T·ª± nh·∫≠n th·ª©c):** Gauging the level of understanding of one's own emotions, strengths, and weaknesses.
*   **Interactive GUI:** üíª A user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter for a smooth assessment experience.
*   **Timed Responses:** ‚è±Ô∏è Each question has a configurable time limit (default: 15 seconds) to encourage intuitive answers.
*   **Likert Scale Input:** Users respond on a 1-5 scale (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree).
*   **Data Persistence:**
    *   üíæ **SQLite Database:** Assessment results (responses, analysis) are stored locally in a `personal_assessment.db` file for historical tracking.
    *   üìÑ **JSON & CSV Export:** Individual assessment data and raw responses can be saved in JSON and CSV formats.
*   **In-depth Analysis:** üîç
    *   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculates mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max scores for each assessment category.
    *   **Strengths & Weaknesses Identification:** Highlights areas of high and low scores based on percentile ranking of category averages.
    *   **K-Means Clustering (Simplified):** Applies K-Means clustering on response values to identify patterns (e.g., groups of low, medium, high responses). *Note: This is a simplified application for pattern discovery.*
*   **Rich Data Visualization (using Plotly):** üìä
    *   **Radar Chart:** Provides a holistic view of an individual's profile across the five main dimensions.
    *   **Bar Chart:** Compares average scores across different assessment categories, color-coded for quick interpretation.
    *   **Pie Chart:** Illustrates the proportion of identified strengths, weaknesses, and neutral areas.
*   **Report Generation:** üóÇÔ∏è Automatically saves generated charts as PNG files and data files (JSON, CSV) into a structured `reports/` directory.
*   **Historical Review:** Allows users to view a list of past assessments stored in the database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies, Algorithms & Tools

### 1. Programming Language
    *   **Python 3.x:** The core language used for development.

### 2. Core Libraries & Frameworks
    *   **Tkinter:** (Python's standard GUI toolkit) Used for building the graphical user interface, providing an interactive experience for the assessment.
    *   **Pandas:** Employed for data manipulation, especially for creating DataFrames to facilitate CSV export and potentially more complex data analysis in future extensions.
    *   **NumPy:** Utilized for numerical operations, particularly for statistical calculations (mean, median, std deviation, percentiles) and array manipulations required by Scikit-learn.
    *   **Plotly:** A powerful interactive graphing library used to generate dynamic and visually appealing charts (Radar, Bar, Pie). These charts can be viewed in a web browser or saved as static images.
    *   **Scikit-learn:**
        *   `StandardScaler`: Used for feature scaling (standardizing response values) before applying K-Means clustering. This ensures that all responses contribute equally to the distance calculations.
        *   `KMeans`: The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to the (scaled) response values to group them into a predefined number of clusters (dynamically adjusted, max 3). This helps in identifying general patterns or tendencies in the user's responses (e.g., predominantly high, medium, or low scores).
    *   **SQLite3:** (Python's built-in module) Used for creating and managing a local SQLite database to store assessment history, allowing users to track their progress over time.
    *   **JSON & CSV Modules:** (Python's built-in modules) Used for serializing assessment data into JSON format and for writing raw responses into CSV files, enabling data portability and external analysis.

### 3. Key Algorithms & Techniques
    *   **Descriptive Statistics:** Standard statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max) are calculated for scores within each assessment category. This provides a quantitative summary of the user's responses.
    *   **Percentile-based Strength/Weakness Identification:** Strengths are identified as categories where the average score is above the 75th percentile of all category averages. Weaknesses are categories with average scores below the 25th percentile. This is a relative measure within the user's own assessment.
    *   **K-Means Clustering:**
        *   **Purpose:** To uncover underlying patterns in the overall response set by grouping similar response values.
        *   **Process:**
            1.  Response values are collected.
            2.  Data is scaled using `StandardScaler` to have zero mean and unit variance.
            3.  `KMeans` algorithm partitions the scaled responses into 'k' clusters (dynamically set, typically 2 or 3 based on data variance).
            4.  The cluster centers and labels are used to infer general response tendencies.
    *   **Timed Event Handling (Tkinter `after`):** Tkinter's `after` method is used to implement the per-question timer, automatically advancing or defaulting the answer if the time limit is reached. Careful management of these timed events (canceling previous ones) is crucial for stability.
    *   **Threading:** The analysis and report generation process is offloaded to a separate thread (`threading` module) after the assessment is complete. This prevents the GUI from freezing during potentially time-consuming calculations and file I/O operations, improving user experience.

### 4. Development & Debugging Tools
    *   **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** (Assumed IDE) With Python extension and `debugpy` for debugging.
    *   **Git & GitHub:** (Assumed for version control and collaboration, if applicable).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   The `PersonalAssessmentSystem` class initializes the question set and the SQLite database.
    *   The `AssessmentGUI` class sets up the main Tkinter window and styles.

2.  **Welcome Screen:**
    *   The user is greeted and prompted to enter their name.

3.  **Assessment Process:**
    *   Upon starting, the GUI iteratively displays each of the 50 questions.
    *   For each question:
        *   The question text and its category are shown.
        *   A progress bar indicates overall completion.
        *   A countdown timer (e.g., 15 seconds) starts.
        *   The user selects a response from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) using radio buttons or corresponding number keys.
        *   If the timer expires before a selection, a neutral response (3) is automatically recorded.
        *   The selected response and question ID are stored.

4.  **Data Analysis (Post-Assessment):**
    *   Once all questions are answered, the collected responses are passed to the `PersonalAssessmentSystem`.
    *   **Category Scoring:** Average, median, standard deviation, min, and max scores are computed for each of the five main categories.
    *   **Strength/Weakness Analysis:** Categories are flagged as strengths or weaknesses based on percentile comparisons of their average scores.
    *   **Clustering:** K-Means clustering is performed on the raw response values to identify general response patterns.

5.  **Report Generation & Visualization:**
    *   The analysis results are used to generate:
        *   A Radar Chart (Plotly) showing the overall profile.
        *   A Bar Chart (Plotly) comparing category averages.
        *   A Pie Chart (Plotly) showing the distribution of strengths/weaknesses.
    *   These charts are saved as PNG images.
    *   The full assessment data (user info, responses, analysis) is saved as a JSON file.
    *   Raw responses are saved as a CSV file.
    *   All results are also committed to the SQLite database.

6.  **Results Display:**
    *   The GUI displays the analysis results in a tabbed interface:
        *   **Overview Tab:** Shows identified strengths, weaknesses, and general statistics.
        *   **Details Tab:** Presents a table with detailed scores for each category.
        *   **Charts Tab:** Provides buttons to view the generated Plotly charts (which open in a browser or Plotly's default viewer).
        *   **Export Tab:** Lists the paths to the saved report files (PNGs, JSON, CSV) and offers options to export to a custom directory or view assessment history.

7.  **Historical Data:**
    *   Users can access a "View History" feature to see a list of their past assessments retrieved from the SQLite database.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.7 or higher.
    *   `pip` (Python package installer).

2.  **Clone the Repository (or download the script):**
    ```bash
    # If it's a Git repository
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
    If you only have the script, save it as `personal_assessment_tool.py` (or your preferred name).

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn kaleido
    ```
    *   `kaleido` is required by Plotly to save charts as static images (e.g., PNG).
    *   `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are included for completeness, though Plotly is the primary charting tool in the GUI version.

5.  **Font for Vietnamese Characters:**
    *   Ensure you have a font that supports Vietnamese characters installed on your system (e.g., Arial, DejaVu Sans, Tahoma). The script attempts to use 'DejaVu Sans' or 'Arial Unicode MS' for Matplotlib (if used), and Plotly generally handles Unicode well but relies on system fonts.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Instructions

1.  **Run the Application:**
    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal (ensure your virtual environment is activated) and run:
    ```bash
    python personal_assessment_tool.py
